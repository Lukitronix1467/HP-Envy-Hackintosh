# HP-Envy-Hackintosh
Succesfull Hackintosh on a HP Envy Laptop model: 17-cg0000ns

## EFI file

The EFI file contains all you need for a clean installation, all drivers, ACPI, kexts are there. After installations all works fine and how should work on a Hackintosh.

### Features

- Clean installation
- Keyboard support
- video, resolution support
- USB ports 3.0 ; 2.1 ; 2.0 ; and type-C works
- Bluetooth and Wifi support

Obviously, Airdrop doesn't works but it apears. You can choose between 2 kexts for Wifi, one is Heliport wich uses the ethernet port (USB-C) as wifi. It's more stable but MacOS doesn't recognise it like Wifi so you don't have airdrop option or Airplay. With the other, wich is twline, you can use wifi as the wifi option on MacOS and the ethernet too. With this option you have Airplay working and other wireless services that MacOS offers.

### Issues

I have some post installation issues that I'm trying to solve.

- Speakers Issue (Speakers doesnÂ´t work, I use Airpods)
- Jack port Issue (Jack port doesn't work, I don't use it anyways)
- Trackpad Issue (Doesn't recognise Trackpad, I use magic mouse (Normal mouse is also available) )

Battery is working for me, keyboard keys... All works fine.
